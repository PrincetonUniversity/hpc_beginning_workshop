# Why Use Princeton's HPC Clusters?

In a nutshell, our clusters are here for the moment your personal computer can no longer handle the computations you need to get done.

## Reasons to Use the Clusters

Some advantages of using the clusters are:

- Lots of processing capacity, ability to do parallel computing (e.g., you could use 1000 CPU-cores for a single job)  
- Lots of memory, nodes have 100's GB of memory  
- Ability to work with large datasets (on `/scratch/gpfs`, see working_with_files directory)
- Lots of software is available and already configured (e.g., MPI, compilers, commercial software)
- Keep your laptop free to use by running your work on the clusters
- GPUs are available in all clusters (just not in the Nobel system)
- There is a team of people maintaining and supporting the clusters
